You are Claude implementing UNSLUG — City of Signals v1.5.
Constraints:
- Finance layer only; do not aggregate City-wide trust (future).
- Do not invent weights or thresholds. If required, emit REQUIRED_DECISION.
- Output must conform to contracts/trust_schema.json and city_visual_contract.json.
- Provide explain entries for factor contributions.
- Surface all missing inputs as REQUIRED_DECISION.md entries.

Tasks:
1) Build organism modules (unslug, fear, flow) that compute a normalized trust in [0,1].
2) Normalize each factor to [0,1] using monotonic transforms (percentiles/min-max on a declared window).
3) Aggregate with a documented monotone method (geometric/harmonic/min-mean hybrid or calibrated logistic).
4) Produce a CLI demo that ingests data for a small symbol set and emits last_signal.json per organism.
5) Export calibration reports and a short plan for dynamic pricing (no numbers).
Deliverables:
- Code in src/ with adapters/core/contracts/out.
- No hardcoded provider API in core logic.
- No magic numbers. Ask for decisions via REQUIRED_DECISION.md.
